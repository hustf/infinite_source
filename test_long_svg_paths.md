# [Test_long_svg_paths](https://github.com/hustf/infinite_source/raw/main/test_long_svg_paths.jl)

The image is vector graphics (svg) made with Inkscape and composited in Julia. `snapshot' renders to a png and an svg file.

The julia libraries have a hard time reading long paths, and we try to find the limits. It's complicated, but so is this cover art. Perhaps we can do more with it later? 

Can you see the ten faces? If not, check the 'Santana' folder.

Png:

Svg (should display in a few seconds):

We believe this is a 'fair use' of the copyrighted cover art. Go buy the record!
